\usage{
iCreateParam()
}
\value{
A list containing all parameters specified by the user during the interaction.
This list includes information about the data file, missing value codes, number of
traits, treatments, noise effects, covariates, interactions, random effects, and
MCMC characteristics if specified.
}
\description{
This function creates a Parameter Configuration File Interactively.

This function guides the user through an interactive process to create a
parameter configuration file. It asks a series of questions about the data file and analysis parameters, which it uses to generate a parameter list.
}
\details{
The user is prompted to specify the data file, which must be located in
the working directory. The function supports `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx`
file formats and allows for the specification of missing value codes. It also
queries the user for information on traits, treatments, noise effects, covariates,
interactions, and random effects to be included in the analysis.

After gathering all necessary information, the function compiles a comprehensive
list of parameters that can be used for further statistical analysis or modeling.

Data file must be located in the current working directory. Missing values can
be coded in various ways and should be explicitly identified during the interaction.
}
\section{Side Effects}{

- The function interacts with the user through the console.
- Depending on user input, it may generate warnings or stop execution if expected
conditions are not met (e.g., file not found, unsupported file format).
